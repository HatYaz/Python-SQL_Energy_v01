To better understand client energy consumption
To better understand client energy consumption, we can use a more exploratory approach by analyzing patterns, trends, and correlations in their usage. We can also apply machine learning techniques to identify usage patterns, predict consumption behavior, and provide recommendations based on the data. Here's how you can approach this:

Data Exploration: Analyze consumption data, such as peak hours, seasonal patterns, and usage spikes.

Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features such as daily, weekly, and monthly trends.

Clustering: Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) to segment clients based on consumption behavior.

Predictive Analysis: Apply regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict future energy consumption based on past behavior.
